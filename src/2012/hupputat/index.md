# Visiting Hupputat

![A lush jungle, surrounded by cliffs.](jungle.png)

The were very few people at Huppatat. On the one hand I could say everyone should come and see this amazing natural phenomenon but in reality it’s something best to wander around at you own pace without jostle of fifty other tourists. We (that is me, Stephen, Daw, Daw’s parents and her friend) did exactly that for I don’t know how long and could have spent even longer.

From afar Huppatat looked like a sheer mountain, the rock face leaping hundreds of meters into the air, levelling off and dropping back down on the other side. At first I thought we were going to hike up to the top but as we got closer I realised we would need harnesses if we wanted to get more than 5 meters above the car park.

The small shop by the car park didn’t appear to sell anything much, Daw’s mum did however borrow a torch from a kiosk at the foot of the path.

It was then that I understood what was going on. The path didn’t go up the mountain, it went through it.
