<h1>Joint Orientation</h1>
<p>Was double checking my local rotation axes before I experimented with alternate IKsolvers (i&rsquo;m wondering if the springIK might help with my multi-joint legs) and realised they were all wrong! oh noes!</p>

<p>Had to go back and fix them wnocn was being more of a pain than I had hoped. Found <a href="http://www.riggingdojo.com/2014/10/03/everything-thought-knew-maya-joint-orient-wrong/">this article</a> which helped me understand whats going on behind the scenes and can avoid that happening in the future.</p>
