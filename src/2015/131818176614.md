<p>The week 7 feedback session was a few days ago. Gave me a bit more confidence in what I am doing. I finished off the rig and Norbert said it was looking good, showed me how to do a smooth bind and the movement is surprisingly good :)</p>

<p>The the skeleton has 55 joints at the moment and the model has 2742 triangles which seems reasonable for a slightly older PC fps type game.</p>

<p>I was looking over the topology of the model again. There will be some more difficult spots like the double (triple?) jointed legs but I think it was a good choice. Feeling better about the module in general atm :)</p>
