<div class="caption"><p>Was having a chat with someone about my slow progress in Technical Art and reading through the lecture slides when I had some kind of magical mental break-through.</p>

<p>Finaly got my tripple jointed legs working using a springIK, figured out what was wrong with my arms and got the shoulders working!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also been thinking about how I want the animator to interact with the rig and tested out locking/hiding things I don&rsquo;t want them to mess with.</p> </div>
