<h1>Continuation</h1>
<p>Today&rsquo;s practical started off simply with cube man but once we got to manipulating skeletons I really felt like I was slowing down. I knew what I was supposed to be doing but felt like I was being hampered by a lack of familiarity with Maya.</p>

<p>Hopefully I will find the time to go through a couple basic modelling tutorials so I can get used to Maya&rsquo;s UI and then spend a couple hours going back over what we did in the practical and finnishing things off. I was at the stage of finalising the bone placement but I still had to align all the local rotation axis or whatever they are called (the things that dictate the orientation of the bones relative to each other).</p>

<p>As daunting as Maya is I do feel like i&rsquo;m getting more comfortable with it. I suppose it will take time to learn it&rsquo;s &lsquo;patterns&rsquo; of interaction and after that things will feel more intuitive, hopefully&hellip;</p>
