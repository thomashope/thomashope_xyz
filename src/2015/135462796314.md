# Hacking the Binary

<p>Been working on making sure things are as neat as possible today. Setting min and max values for attributes. I wanted to reorganise the set driven key attributes for the hands but after some searching online found that it couldn&rsquo;t be done in Maya. It was possible however to change the order in which they were created by saving the scene as an ASCII file and modifying the file itself with a text editor. You can watch a video on how to do this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtTJBuMOgKk">here</a>.</p>
