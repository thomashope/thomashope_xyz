<h1>Tutorials</h1>
<p>Been working through the tutorials by <a href="http://zurbrigg.com/maya-python/category/beginning-python-for-maya">Chris Zurbrigg</a> to get a better handle on how scripting works in general. Todays lab/lecture was on creating a picker. Some of the interfaces shown looked really nice while also being acheivable in the time I have. Spent time in the lab doing a layout implementation.</p>

<p>I also went ahead and bought Charcoal Editor and i&rsquo;m glad I did, makes life a lot easier.</p>
