<h1>Pre-Feedback Session</h1>
<p>Watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0E0JjA9Oig">Rigging the Last of Us</a> video hoping for inspiration.</p>

<p>Had a read through the week 6 lecture that I missed when visiting Adrian in hospital but haven&rsquo;t found the time to actually try writing the script yet. It&rsquo;s not even half way through the semester and I&rsquo;m feeling really pressed for time&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what kind of script I could develop beyond what has been suggested in class. I don&rsquo;t really feel I know enough about the rigging / modeling proccess to spot areas that could be improved with a script. Here&rsquo;s hoping I&rsquo;ll get some clarity in the session tomorrow.</p>
