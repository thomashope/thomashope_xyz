$$AUTOPLAY_VIDEO(../../media/135534087304.mp4)$$

<div class="caption"><p>Been working on the picker a lot today. I realised when setting up the selection buttons that some of my control shapes were named incorrectly. Following that I decided to add a renaming tab to the picker and after a bit of fiddling its working really well!</p>

<p>The video shows a typical problem I was having. The button wouldn&rsquo;t select the desired control shape, hovering over the button shows what the target should be. Switching to the rename tab I find the typo, fix it and hit rename. Then heading back to the model tab the button now works.</p>

<h2>Images Sadness</h2>

<p>After a couple hours of trying to make a background image work I found <a href="http://www.creativecrash.com/forums/mel/topics/can-controls-overlay-an-image">a couple</a> of <a href="http://forums.cgsociety.org/archive/index.php?t-858764.html">threads</a> that seems to be saying that I can&rsquo;t have a background image in a tabbed layout</p>

<pre><code>Sometimes if you have your formLayout
inside a tabLayout if you switch tabs it will 
redraw your image on top of your buttons ...
