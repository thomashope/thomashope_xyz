<div class="caption"><p>Missed the class on friday due to family visiting but went through the scipting tutorial at home. I can really see myself getting into this.</p>

<p>You can view the script i wrote <a href="https://gist.github.com/Cyphre117/6ae71475a471de58d7c8">by clicking on this beautiful blue text</a>.</p>

<p>I also found some good tutorials on scripting by <a href="http://zurbrigg.com/maya-python/category/beginning-python-for-maya">Chris Zurbrigg</a>. Then fiddled with his Maya Plugin <a href="http://zurbrigg.com/charcoal-editor">Charcoal Editor</a> because the default script editor isn&rsquo;t so snazzy. Sadly Charcoal Editor costs $$$ so I should try and find something else in the long term as the demo doesn&rsquo;t let you save :(</p>

<p>p.s. <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/2015/ENU/Maya-Tech-Docs/CommandsPython/index.html">documentation lives here</a></p> </div>
