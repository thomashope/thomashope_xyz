<div class="caption"><h2>First Lesson</h2>

<p>Imported a basic character rig and had a go at animating. For some reason I made him do an akward rocking motion as if he didn&rsquo;t know what to say, I suppose thats appropriate.</p>

<p>One problem I bumped into was when trying to get his hand to rest naturaly on his hip, moving the thumb to such an extreme angle caused the hand to start intersecting with itself. Something to think about when riggin my own models.</p> </div>
