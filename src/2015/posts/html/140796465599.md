<h1>Grades!</h1>
<p>Got my grades back and, to my suprise, i got an <strong>A</strong>!</p>

<p>I really had no idea what to expect from this module. I was pretty confident I was going to pass but beyond that I didn&rsquo;t really have any point of reference.</p>

<p>Super happy :)</p>

<p>That makes my grades for semester one 2 As and an A+ for graphics programming!</p>
