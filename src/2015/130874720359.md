<div class="caption"><p>Slow but steady progress with building the skeleton. I chose a hellknight model from Doom 3, seemed like good topology although the shape of the model will restict things like raising the arms above the head.</p>

<p>For some reason i&rsquo;m nervous of mirroring all the joints because&hellip; actually I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>

<p>There is lots of oppertunity to get fancy with this mesh. The legs bend in three places and the head is in a kind of socket so i structered it similarly to the wrist in the hope I will be able to make it rotate properly.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also for better or worse given him double knees and elbows. It&rsquo;s the least he deservers, poor guy doesn&rsquo;t have any eyes.</p>

<p>Been catching up on the GUI scripting which I missed last week. I was stuck for a while getting the window to delete itself but it was just me being silly. The majority of the code seems straight forward.</p> </div>
