__*Prints are expected to become available Q3 2023.*__

## What's in Store?

The next planned release for the shop it a set of limited edition, high quality photo prints.

Prints will be produced on Canson archival paper and signed, numbered, and titled in pencil on the front.

Printing is done in collaboration with my brother [Adam Hope](https://adamhope.com/photography).

## Why?

Sometimes my hobbies end up producing physical things. If I'm gong to make them, I might as well make them available for people to buy.

Plus selling things on the internet seams like fun.
