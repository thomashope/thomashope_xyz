# Short variables are good!

This is where I explain why:

1. one
2. two
3. three 


<pre><code>A code example to demonstrate my point.
</code></pre>

<pre><code>A code example to demonstrate my point.	

An even longer code example to demonstrate my point. An even longer code example to demonstrate my point. An even longer code example to demonstrate my point.
</code></pre>

There, now you are convinced.
