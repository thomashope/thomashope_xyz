# Grades!

Got my grades back and, to my suprise, I got an **A**!

I really had no idea what to expect from this module. I was pretty confident I was going to pass but beyond that I didn&rsquo;t really have any point of reference.

Super happy :)

That makes my grades for semester one 2 As and an A+ for Graphics Programming!
